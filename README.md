Immersive music experience -- just for fun

Tapremin is designed to be an immersive musical experience, inspired by the theremin. Players use the touch slider on the FRDM-KL25Z board to control the frequency of the sound output by the piezo buzzers, and can see a visual representation of the musical notes on a LED matrix that is connected in the system.*
